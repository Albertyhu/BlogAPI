HOW THE TAGS WORK: 

In a Post document, the tag field is an array of ObjectId's of Tag documents. 
When the client updates tags for a post, it will send two array of tags. 
The arrays are stringified in the client and then parsed in the server.
One array will be an old list of tags. 
The other array will be an updated list of tags. 
They are used to determine which tags are deleted, which tags are added which tags are to be kept. 
The deleted and kept tags will have the fields post, ObjectId's, and names.
The new tags will only have the field names and will rely on the server to create new objectId's for them. 
That is handled in the Tag Controller function savePostIDToTags.
